## General Info

In this project, we explore HTTP concepts such as URLs, HTTP requests, responses, headers, and more. We also create Bash scripts to interact with web resources using the `cURL` command.

## Technologies

- Bash
- `cURL`
- Python 3

## Setup

To run the scripts in this project, you'll need access to a Unix-like environment (e.g., Ubuntu) and the `cURL` command-line tool.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x10-python-network_0` directory.
3. Make the scripts executable if needed: `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
4. Run the scripts with appropriate arguments: `./script_name.sh argument`.

## Script Details

- `0-body_size.sh`: This script takes a URL as an argument, sends an HTTP request using `cURL`, and displays the size of the response body in bytes.
